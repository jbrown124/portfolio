# Data Scientist/Analyst

# About
I am a recent graduate from the University of Michigan with a Bachelorâ€™s in Statistics, and I am eager for the opportunity to begin my career as a Data Analyst. I believe that my educational background combined with my constant pursuit of knowledge allows me to be a great addition to any team.

During my academic career, I developed a solid foundation in statistical analysis and data interpretation. My coursework in probability, regression analysis, and statistical computing has equipped me with the necessary knowledge to perform robust data analysis. I have experience in programming languages such as R, Python, and SQL, which I have used extensively to manipulate and analyze datasets. I also have experience using Tableau to create interactive dashboards.

I am passionate about making data-driven decisions and aim to stay up-to-date on the best tools and methods for accurate data analysis.
